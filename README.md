### SANBI repository for Galaxy Community Conference 2016

This repository contains posters and other content for the Galaxy Community Conference 2016 (GCC2016). 

### The posters

The posters for the conference were created using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) and version controlled using `git` (for Mac users, apparently [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) is a good GUI). Rendered versions of the posters are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/SANBI-SA/GCC2016/releases).
